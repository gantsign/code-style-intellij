# GantSign Code Style Configuration

Code Style Configuration for code written by GantSign using IntelliJ IDEA.

# About

The GantSign IntelliJ Code Style focuses on readability and minimizing version
control changes.

The indent is 2 (rather than 4) spaces to make functional style code more
readable (functional code often has deeper levels of nesting).

Mandatory line wrapping for enum/array values and implements/extends/throws
lists both aids readability and minimizes the scope of version control changes.

Continuation indents are fixed rather than aligned with parentheses to eliminate
unnecessary version control changes.

Line wrapping by the developer is preserved so the developer can manually layout
the code for better readability.
